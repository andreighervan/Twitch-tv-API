# Twitch.tv_API
Twitch.tv API example to get information for specific channels

How it works
1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
3. If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
